This site is 100% my design, and full of goodies. I even built out the Pinterest. Who knows, maybe you will find it useful! </figcaption>

We did a quick refresh by making it a single-scroller for mobile users, adding some cute hand-made icons, and giving it a slightly sleeker UI. This is a Wix site.</figcaption>

    <h3> Where are the rest of your sites? </h3>
    <p>
        Glad you asked! I typically work on big projects (a few of which are still being built) that take lots of time and typically include other designers. Here are some examples of sites I have worked on, without designing the entire thing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.wyldergoods.com" target="_blank"> Wylder</a> - sustainable and ethical Women's outdoor shop
The Olive Branch - fair trade shop. I updated inventory and took product photography.</li>
      <li><a href="https://the-olive-branch.shoplightspeed.com/" target="_blank"> The Olive Branch</a> - fair trade shop. I updated inventory and took product photography.</li>
      <li><a href="https://accessrvrental.com/rv-trip-planner-utah/" target="_blank"> Access RV Rental</a> - RV rentals. Many of the banners (jumbotron) are my design, and also check out the cool icons I made!</li>
      <li> And, of course, this one! I built it with Next.js and my super knowledge of JSX and JSS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What kind of sites can you build?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wordpress</li>
      <li>Standard HTML/CSS/JS</li>
      <li>Small React/Next.js apps</li>
      <li> Responsive, mobile-first / mobile-friendly </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Why are you a web designer? </h3>
    <p>
      I started with graphic design but became entranced by the UX that web design offers. I love building things that are meant to be interacted with, tested, and changed. There are always new exciting ways to create websites and apps. I love learning and improving, so it's a natural fit!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an AAS of Design (graduated 2016), Web Emphasis and attended a Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp (2017).
