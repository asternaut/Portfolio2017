They specialize in bringing together health and medicine oriented software for a fun plug-n-play environment.We are still in the process of creating the perfect logo: these are two variations.</figcaption>

I wanted to show how cool coding makes you feel. Thus an edgy, trendy set of logos and design elements. The target audience, after all, is teenagers.

      <figcaption> <span> 03. </span>CLOTHING THAT DOES GOOD: way back when I helped build a little clothing collective. As a B Corp, building our community was part of our profit model. I wanted the logo to symbolize movement, passion, and style. We settled on simple black and white for elegance, a square frame for structure, and thick lines for sturdiness.</figcaption>

      <figcaption> <span> 04. </span> HAVE FUN: logo design is HARD. I typically fill up pages with rejected doodles. That shouldn't mean it can't be fun! This logo design was inspired, oddly enough, by comic books and 3-D glasses. I used really bold elements, bright retro colors, and subtle halftone patterns for this design.</figcaption>

      <h3> Where are the rest of your sites? </h3>
      <p>
          Glad you asked! I typically work on big projects (a few of which are still being built) that take lots of time and typically include other designers. Here are some examples of sites I have worked on, without designing the entire thing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.wyldergoods.com" target="_blank"> Wylder</a> - sustainable and ethical Women's outdoor shop
  The Olive Branch - fair trade shop. I updated inventory and took product photography.</li>
        <li><a href="https://the-olive-branch.shoplightspeed.com/" target="_blank"> The Olive Branch</a> - fair trade shop. I updated inventory and took product photography.</li>
        <li><a href="https://accessrvrental.com/rv-trip-planner-utah/" target="_blank"> Access RV Rental</a> - RV rentals. Many of the banners (jumbotron) are my design, and also check out the cool icons I made!</li>
        <li> And, of course, this one! I built it with Next.js and my super knowledge of JSX and JSS.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What kind of sites can you build?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wordpress</li>
        <li>Standard HTML/CSS/JS</li>
        <li>Small React/Next.js apps</li>
        <li> Responsive, mobile-first / mobile-friendly </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Why are you a web designer? </h3>
      <p>
        I started with graphic design but became entranced by the UX that web design offers. I love building things that are meant to be interacted with, tested, and changed. There are always new exciting ways to create websites and apps. I love learning and improving, so it's a natural fit!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an AAS of Design (graduated 2016), Web Emphasis and attended a Full Stack Javascript Bootcamp (2017).
